    <i><u><h3>Childhood Years</h3></u></i>

        <p><blockquote><blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dwayne Monty G. Leaño</b> is 20 years old and grew up in Antipolo City.<sup>1</sup> He grew up with his lolo and mama since 
        his father was working abroad at that time.<sup>2</sup> When he was
        in kindergarten, he wouldn’t agree to be left behind by his lolo, so his lolo was forced to
        stay in school to accompany him.<sup>3</sup> Most of the time, Dwayne played with his cousins from
        his mother’s side.<sup>4</sup> When he was young, he used to have yayas.<sup>5</sup> They came and went due
        to circumstances on their end.<sup>6</sup> But when he grew up to 7 years old, the one who looked
        after him was his lolo.<sup>7</sup> His lolo would escort and fetch him from school since his mother
        came home from work at 7 in the evening.<sup>8</sup> His grade school days were filled with lots of
        fun.<sup>9</sup> He went to Our Lady of Peace School in grade school as well as junior high school.<sup>10</sup> He had a brother who was born when he was 
        in grade 4 (2013).<sup>11</sup> They moved houses
        from their lolo’s house to their own house when he was also in grade 4.<sup>12</sup> Outside of school,
        he was active in playing around with his friends after moving to Kingsville Hills (his current
        home) when he was in grade 4.<sup>13</sup> He would constantly go home late from playing outside,
        enjoying all kinds of games with his friends like <i>Basketball, Patintero, Agawan Base, etc.</i><sup>14</sup> He also enjoyed biking around the 
        neighborhood, racing with his friends on the streets
        until sunset.<sup>15</sup> During weekends, he would wake up early just to play outside, sometimes
        forgetting to eat breakfast because he was too excited.<sup>16</sup> But that would soon come to an
        end after discovering an online game called League of Legends.<sup>17</sup> He would try to download
        it on their family laptop, but it sucked since the specs couldn’t handle the workload of the
        game.<sup>18</sup> Because of that, he would go to computer shops after school or on the weekends.<sup>19</sup> He would meet friends from 
        school who also played the same game, who would also be
        his friends until now.<sup>20</sup></blockquote></blockquote></p>

    <i><u><h3>Teenage Years</h3></u></i>
    <div>
        <p><blockquote><blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his teenage years, after graduating from grade school, he continued studying
            at Our Lady of Peace School since his cousins also went there.<sup>1</sup> They were escorted to
            and picked up from school together by their lolo, who was mentioned earlier.<sup>2</sup> When he
            was in grade 7, he saw his cousin, whom he had played with since childhood, join the
            school’s marching band.<sup>3</sup> He watched the drum and lyre band perform and was amazed
            and inspired to join as well.<sup>4</sup> But when he auditioned, he did not get accepted.<sup>5</sup> Since the
            band only held auditions once a year for new members, he had to wait another year to
            try again.<sup>6</sup> He was crushed because he had dreamed of performing with the band in front
            of a crowd. After a year, when he was in grade 8, he auditioned again and was accepted.<sup>7</sup> He was overjoyed, but he soon realized that being in the band was even harder than the
            audition. <sup>8</sup>His teenage years revolved around the band.<sup>9</sup> Although practices were
            exhausting and he often came home late from school, he enjoyed every moment.<sup>10</sup> When
            he reached grade 9, COVID-19 shocked the world. <sup>11</sup>His family suffered a huge loss when
            his lolo passed away due to the virus.<sup>12</sup> This was probably the lowest point of his life.<sup>13</sup> During the pandemic, his daily routine consisted of online classes and playing games with
            his friends.<sup>14</sup> His friends became his source of comfort, helping him get through tough
            times by making things more enjoyable.<sup>15</sup> Fast forward two years, he transferred to
            Antipolo Institute of Technology.<sup>16</sup> At first, he felt scared and uncomfortable since this was
            the first time in years that he was not surrounded by familiar faces from his old school.<sup>17</sup> However, because the tuition was free, as the school was government-sponsored, he
            decided to push through with the transfer.<sup>18</sup> Over time, he was able to find new friends
            and experience things he never would have in his previous school.<sup>19</sup> Looking back, he realizes that every challenge he faced helped shape him into 
            the resilient and adaptable person he is today.<sup>20</sup></blockquote></blockquote></p>

    <i><u><h3>College Years</h3></u></i>
    <div>
        <p><blockquote><blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After graduating from Antipolo Institute of Technology, he decided to enroll at the
            University of the East to pursue a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology.<sup>1</sup> He
            heard that UE offers quality education and chose to study there.<sup>2</sup> He compared the tuition
            fees of universities offering the same course and found that UE had the lowest tuition
            fee.<sup>3</sup> However, he was disappointed when he learned that tuition fees increase every year.<sup>4</sup> Since he is from Antipolo, 
            his daily commute was long and exhausting.<sup>5</sup> During the first
            few weeks of school, he struggled and wondered if he could manage this routine for four
            years.<sup>6</sup> Over time, he got used to it and no longer minded the travel except, of course,
            when there was heavy traffic.<sup>7</sup> When he started at UE, he was able to invite an old friend
            from his previous school to join him.<sup>8</sup> He also had no trouble making new friends and
            acquaintances.<sup>9</sup> However, school was much harder than he expected.<sup>10</sup> The workload was
            overwhelming at times, and there were moments when he felt like giving up.<sup>11</sup> Sleepless
            nights became common as he juggled multiple projects, quizzes, and exams.<sup>12</sup> Despite the
            challenges, he remained determined and pushed through every obstacle.<sup>13</sup> He sought help
            from his classmates, managed his time better, and slowly adapted to the demands of
            college life.<sup>14</sup> Because of his hard work during his first semester in his first year, he earned
            a college scholarship.<sup>15</sup> However, in the following semesters, he fell just short of the
            required grade, narrowly missing the scholarship each time.<sup>16</sup> His perseverance paid off,
            and now, he is in his second year, more confident and prepared to take on whatever
            challenges come next.<sup>17</sup> Although he was unable to regain the scholarship, he remains
            motivated to do his best, hoping to achieve it again in the future.<sup>18</sup> He has also developed better study habits and 
            learned to balance academics with personal time.<sup>19</sup> Looking ahead, he remains optimistic and determined to make the most of his college journey, 
            aiming to excel in his field and achieve his long-term goals.<sup>20</sup></blockquote></blockquote></p>
